import "./style.css"
console.log("hello");

// how to start
// first i'll need an empty list to hold the projects
// when a new project is added it'll be appended to this list

// the projects themselves will be a dictionary 
// the key will be the name of the project and the value will be the list of tasks
// the tasks will be a custom data type that will have various features

// so a function to create "tasks" which will be a custom object this can be a factory function or a class
// another function to add these tasks to their projects this can just be projects["tasks"] with both of those as parameters
// and another function to add the projects to the list. this may be redundant or not needed later on.
// another function to link this with the dom
